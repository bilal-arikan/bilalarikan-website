I know Python, C #, Java (Android), and Javascript languages very well, I&#8217;ve done many projects up to this time and have used libraries as much. I know somethings about many other languages. I also know linux operating system and its variants (Ubuntu, RaspberryPi, Kali, etc.)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am overly concerned with topics such as BigData, Artificial Intelligence, Artificial Neural Networks, and so on (I have a few projects I have done in the beginner and middle level), I am also learning something about the recently popular technology Blockchain. I have been educated about cyber security, but I have not been very interested in that area.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of the these I have learned to do my own research or learned with my friends, I have developed small projects (2-3 people) as a team, I am confident that I will work with teammates very efficiently with my teammates.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are some games or similar projects that we have developed as a hobby (with Unreal Engine or Unity Simulation, Vr, Ar, etc \u2026) As a language I can read and write English well, but I am very experienced in face-to-face conversation (I will also be taking international exams as soon as possible) and recently I am trying to learn Chinese and Spanish.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Visual Design, Drawing, Black Pen drawing etc. I also have talents in the topics and I love working with these topics<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized is-style-rounded\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.bilalarikan.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/hg_800_389.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-17\" width=\"575\" height=\"278\" srcset=\"http:\/\/128.199.36.238\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/hg_800_389-300x146.png 300w, http:\/\/128.199.36.238\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/hg_800_389-768x373.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 575px) 100vw, 575px\" \/><\/figure>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I have recently graduated from Maltepe University Software (100% Scholarship) (English) Department and I have always tried to improve myself in Programming and Project Management throughout my university life.
